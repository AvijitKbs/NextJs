//Interview questions

Argument vs parameter-Arguments are called at time of sending and parameters are called at time of receiving.
Rest vs spread -Rest are called when we have to receive a inuput ,e.g- suppose,we have to receive many arguments as parameters ,in that case to receive all at short syntax we use rest. vs when we have to access or get output of every items in an array / object ,we use spread.Both have same syntax and also equivalent but not equal.
SetInterval or settimeout doesn't work properly in for loop,they have to wait till loop is over and then continue with the last item of i in the loop.
e.g-
for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i)
  }, 1000);
}
will result in printing 5 onetime.E.g we write

ForEach loop vs map is for each loop returns undefined while map returns a new array and map is chainable i.e can use filter,sort,reduce methods while in case of for each we can't use them and with foreach we can't use them as it gives undefined in return.We use forEach if we don't want return data,and map if we want returned array.

difference between state and variable in react ?
We use state instead of variables to update state beacuse state is under immutability (core concept) under react,while declaring variable will
make our react app mutable which may cause to behave our app in an inappropriate way as in every change state rerenders but in case of variables
that does not occur.

stale state-this problem ocurs when we update state inside a closure,i.e the state may not take the latest value of state immediately ,which can be
          handled using setTimeout.

Difference between call vs apply,bind ?
image in public doesn't work if browser router used in case of nested router,we have to keep images in src and import and use images.
Filder used for debugging http requests(api),while postman is a complete API development environment.
=================
//NextJS

Every file in public folder is publically available.
Pages folder-

We use [] ,to use dynamic routes.
Next js gives us flexibility to use Head , Body differently
while using script tag in next , sometimes it takes time to load script,so we use strategy=lazyload to enable to load script only
after page's render.
Don't use Next's Script in head section in nextjs.
Nextjs gives Image component to optimize and lazyload large images
Next link-to navigate
Navigate page can be created in public
style jsx
component.Module.css-for component level styles
Global.css -for global style in all components.

Server side rendering-Load api data before preparing HTML (by browser),then give it to browser,the full HTML,which is very helpful for SEO purposes.
Client Side Rendering-
